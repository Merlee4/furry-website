            Occasionally, I get the question “How do I get into technical alpine
            climbing?”

          <h1>Here’s my Story.</h1>
          <p id="many">
            Very few people are lucky or determined enough to climb full time
            once they discover they are passionate about it and I am not one of
            those people. In the grand scheme of things, I have not done much,
            and I have a lot to learn, but it has still taken me six years to
            get to where I am today. On the weekends, I dabble in rock climbing,
            waterfall ice climbing and ski mountaineering, but what I enjoy most
            is getting to the summit of a mountain that requires both glacier
            travel and pitching out some rock sections. I love having to deal
            with several different types of terrain, using the skills I’ve
            acquired over the years, and carrying all the equipment I need to
            complete the objective. All of this started with hiking to my first
            summit six years ago.

          I was hooked. And weekend after weekend I ticked off the scrambles
          closest to home. That same summer I took an intro to rock climbing
          course, and while I didn’t do much climbing outside, the rope skills
          seamlessly transferred to learning how to ice climb that winter.
          Learning crevasse rescue and trad climbing skills happened in the
          following years and I’ve been trying to get as much as experience as
          possible doing all of it since. Of course, hiring a guide to manage a
          lot of the risks for you is always an option, but to me, the
          experience is way more valuable knowing I have the skills to do it
          myself. If photos of daring climbers in Chamonix and Patagonia make
          your heart beat faster and your eyes sparkle, but you’ve never been on
          a mountain before, here’s how to start on your journey there:
